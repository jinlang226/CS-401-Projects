/* CS 0401 Spring 2019
 * This example (along with files PlayList.java and Song.java) demonstrates a lot
 * of things, which will be covered as the term progresses.  After we cover
 * a topic in lecture, come back to this handout to see it demonstrated.
 * 1) Creating a new class and determining the correct instance variables
 *    and methods
 * 2) Using the process of COMPOSITION to build a new class using data that
 *    is previously defined in one or more other classes
 * 3) Using arrays of objects to store multiple values in a single variable
 * 4) Using a text file for input data
 * 5) Using the wrapper class method Integer.parseInt to convert from a String
 *    to an int
 * 6) Using the Comparable interface to facilitate comparisons of objects
