// CS 0401 Spring 2019
// Simple class to represent a music playlist.

// The class here is very simple -- containing only a single constructor and
// a toString() method [and compareTo method, which will be discussed later].
// As an exercise you may want to add some additional constructors, accessors
// and mutators.

// See PlayListTest.java for a simple test program.  If you add to this class you
// can also add to PlayListTest.java to demonstrate the new features.

public class PlayList implements Comparable<PlayList> // See more info below
{
	// Note that the primary instance variable within the PlayList class
	// is an array of Song, which is a different class (see Song.java).  
	// The process of using a variable of one class as instance data in
	// another class is COMPOSITION.  The idea is that we are using pre-existing
	// classes to compose a new class.  The functionality of the new class is
	// at least partially based on the functionality of the classes used to build
	// it.

	             // Date object.  This will allow us to manipulate it
	             // as a Date if we so choose.  Note that this could be
	             // stored in various ways.  This also demonstrates the idea
